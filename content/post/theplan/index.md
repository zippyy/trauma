Back at the beginning, letâ€™s start with leaving everything and everyone I knew and loved behind. I had no plan until I had THE plan and that plan has turned out beyond my wildest dreams. 

August 2020. My now ex-husband moved out of our house and into his girlfriendâ€™s house (just down the street);I sold everything I could and moved the last of what I couldnâ€™t sell into my parentsâ€™ house-again. To say that I was broken is truly putting it mildly. I hated the way that I felt but couldnâ€™t make it stop. I had get far, far away from every memory (they were all lies, after all). So what started as a plan to leave with help, turned into a plan for leaving alone. 

In roughly 4 weeks time I : applied for several and was offered the perfect job, applied for and was approved for the perfect starter apartment, and started planning for the things Iâ€™d need to purchase once relocating. 

Sept 2020. I caught my plane on Thursday, signed my lease on Friday, spent all my money over the weekend ðŸ˜‚, and started my new job on Tuesday. Iâ€™d say I couldnâ€™t have planned it better if Iâ€™d had tried!

On to post three!
