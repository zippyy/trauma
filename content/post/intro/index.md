Pinch me. This is really my life?! How can this even be real?? I ask myself often how I managed to embark on such a huge adventure-totally alone. Trauma. Thatâ€™s how. Being so broken and Ashamed of yourself that you felt no other option than to start over-totally solo. This journey started in the middle of COVID:year one 2020. Sept of 2020 I hopped a plane with three suitcases and never looked back. Okay, that may not be totally true, but I never went back. (Not to stayðŸ™ƒ).

Roughly 18 months later, here I am happily divorced, and enthralled in this wonderful adventure with a wonderful new man and Iâ€™m about to embark on a whole chapter of this adventure. And Iâ€™m so mind blown! 

Before the â€™newâ€™ begins, the â€˜currentâ€™ and â€˜beforeâ€™ are super important parts of this incredible journey Iâ€™ve been on. You gotta start at the beginning for the growth to make sense. 

On to post two!
