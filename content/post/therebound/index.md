I met a few guys in the first few months that I was in Colorado, but not many that are worth writing about. I never truly believed in ‚Äúthe rebound‚Äù before but, shit, I do now. One guy I encountered in the glorious world of online dating stuck around a while. The amount of mixed emotions that I had to process from this brief situationship still totally blows my mind. 

Every good feeling came with twice as much anxiety later. 

I was sick. 
I knew this feeling. 
I just ran away from this feeling.
This isn‚Äôt going to happen again.
 I promised myself that it would never happen again. 
If this was the right thing, it wouldn‚Äôt feel like this. 
So.
Even tho it was hard, and it didn‚Äôt feel great, I set boundaries with this guy and he eventually removed himself from our situation. This revealing that he truly wasn‚Äôt the guy meant for me. 


Everything I had to process in this season helped me to heal for what was going to happen in the near future. All of the emotional healing that I needed time with myself for, was given to me. God always provides. 

Hindsight is 20/20, and thank you God because the man I have now is far beyond what I ever imagined üòç.
